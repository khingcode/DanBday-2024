            <p>Hi Dan, Belated Happy Happy Birthday and Happy 1 year sa CCF!, I know this is late but I HOPE you will enjoy
                and appreciate this late but simple website I made hehe. I'm proud that you made it this far and
                praise God for you and for our friendship! ðŸ’œ Whatever you're going through Dan, always know na God sees it all
                so you don't hesitate to reach out to him. I admire the way you're able to make people feel comfortable around you
                and that's not something everyone can do, I love it when you chat and update me about random things, and I love your company when you're around
                because you're fun to talk to and I have someone to HUGGG. Alam mo, appreciate ko everytime na mag share ka
                ng problems or struggles mo, especially mga INSECURITIES cuz I know that's hard to do, maging honest and 
                vulnerable, kasi at the same it shows na you trust me, and I will do my best to keep that trust. I pray that you'll
                learn to grow out of your old habits, and know that you aren't just a temporary friend to me or anyone. Godly friendships
                are very different from worldy ones. They're genuine, loving, forgiving, and more fun because it's all from God. 
                Continue to fight the good fight, friend! I love u very much ðŸ’œ We've been through a lot, but there's a lot of things
                we still didn't do so im excited for that. To more adventuress!!!! Let's take more pics together and share our adventures
                with God ðŸ’œ
